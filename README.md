# Sample-Codes-to-create-Ussd-sms-application---menu

Disclaimare -- Sample codes are only formatted and placed on tangible soft copies to suit my learning objective, however, they are as created by the course instructor Mr. Derdus Kenga, PhD || Content Developer II @Microsoft and, a part time Lecturer Strathmore University.

To test these codes you can fire a simulator on Africa's Talking website. (Check their website for details) or You can do a manual code test on an installed Postman on your machine or a postman agent to help run postman on your browser, after ofcourse installing and starting apache on xampp.

Create a "Your_folder" on Xampp->Htdocs->your_folder- then open it on your preferred IDE. THEN Create a php file - example.php. now you are good to go!

//Path to test on Postman: as follows

localhost/'your_folder'/example.php
